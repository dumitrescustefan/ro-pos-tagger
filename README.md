# Romanian Part Of Speech Tagger

This repo contains code to train a POS tagger on Universal Dependencies' Ro RRT dataset.

It is used to eval transformer language models on [Romanian Transformers](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/Romanian-Transformers) . Maybe it will develop into a usable model sometime in the future. In the mean time, if you want POS tagging, use NLP-Cube, Stanza or Spacy ;)
